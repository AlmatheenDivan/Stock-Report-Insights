# Stock-Report-Insights
Final Year Project


Stock Report Insights
Overview
Stock Report Insights is an intelligent system that automates stock market analysis by generating real-time, data-driven reports. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), it provides actionable insights for investors and analysts. The system leverages LangChain for workflow orchestration, Azure OpenAI for natural language generation, yfinance for stock data, and TextBlob/VADER for sentiment analysis, addressing the inefficiencies of manual stock analysis.
Features

Automates generation of comprehensive stock reports using real-time data, news, and social media sentiment.
Fetches live and historical stock data via Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage APIs.
Analyzes market sentiment from news and social media using TextBlob and VADER.
Predicts stock trends with statistical methods like Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Linear Regression.
Generates customizable, human-readable reports through Azure OpenAIâ€™s GPT models.
Offers an intuitive web interface built with Streamlit or Flask for user interaction.
Ensures scalability and security for handling large data volumes and sensitive financial information.
